My advice to you is get married: If you find a good wife you’ll be happy; if not, you’ll become a philosopher
If you want to be sure that you never forget your wife’s birthday, just try forgetting it once
Before you marry a person, you should first make them use a computer with slow Internet service to see who they really are
Never criticize your spouse’s faults; if it weren’t for them, your mate might have found someone better than you
Never go to bed mad. Stay up and fight

When your mother asks, ‘Do you want a piece of advice?’ it is a mere formality. It doesn’t matter if you answer yes or no. You’re going to get it anyway
Kids are expensive, I didn’t even realize how broke I was until last year someone stole my identity and it ruined her life
I want my children to have all the things I couldn’t afford. Then I want to move in with them

If you think dogs can’t count, try putting three dog biscuits in your pocket and then giving Fido only two of them
The cat could very well be man’s best friend but would never stoop to admitting it
Cats are smarter than dogs. You can’t get eight cats to pull a sled through snow

Anybody who tells you money can’t buy happiness never had any
Misers are no fun to live with, but they make great ancestors
Anyone can do any amount of work, provided it isn’t the work he is supposed to be doing at that moment
I like work; it fascinates me. I can sit and look at it for hours
Doing nothing is very hard to do. You never know when you’re finished
Hard work never killed anybody, but why take a chance?
Don’t go around saying the world owes you a living. The world owes you nothing. It was here first

When the waitress asked if I wanted my pizza cut into four or eight slices, I said, ‘Four. I don’t think I can eat eight
Not all chemicals are bad. Without hydrogen and oxygen, for example, there would be no way to make water, a vital ingredient in beer
I always cook with wine. Sometimes I even add it to the food
Always do sober what you said you’d do drunk. That will teach you to keep your mouth shut
All the things I like to do are either immoral, illegal, or fattening
Health nuts are going to feel stupid someday, lying in hospitals dying of nothing
Be careful about reading health books. You may die of a misprint
It is useless to try to hold a person to anything he says while he’s madly in love, drunk, or running for office

If our Founding Fathers wanted us to care about the rest of the world, they wouldn’t have declared their independence from it
If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. There’s no use being a damn fool about it
It is not enough to succeed. Others must fail

A bore is the kind of man who, when you ask him how he is, he tells you

By the time someone says, ‘To make a long story short,’ it’s too late
There but for the grace of God, goes God
He is a self-made man and worships his creator
The nice thing about egotists is that they don’t talk about other people
People who think they know everything are a great annoyance to those of us who do
An optimist is someone who falls off the Empire State Building, and after 50 floors says, ‘So far so good
The nice part about being a pessimist is that you are constantly being either proven right or pleasantly surprised
The optimist proclaims that we live in the best of all possible worlds; and the pessimist fears this is true
I’m not offended by blonde jokes because I know I’m not dumb…and I also know that I’m not blonde
We use 10% of our brains. Imagine how much we could accomplish if we used the other 60%.
My definition of an intellectual is someone who can listen to the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger
When it doubt, look intelligent
Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I’m not sure about the universe
Think of how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that
User: the word computer professionals use when they mean ‘idiot
If stupidity got us into this mess, then why can’t it get us out?
According to most studies, people’s number one fear is public speaking. Number two is death. Death is number two. Does that seem right? That means to the average person, if you have to go to a funeral, you’re better off in the casket than doing the eulogy
I don’t believe in reincarnation, and I didn’t believe in it when I was a hamster
Always go to other people’s funerals; otherwise they won’t come to yours
